    "Ans-Inheritance is one of the core concepts of object-oriented programming (OOP) languages. It is a mechanism where you can derive a class from another class for a hierarchy of classes that share a set of attributes and methods.And a class that inherits from another class shares all the attributes and methods of the referenced class.\n",
    "\n",
    "Inheritance is used in OOP because it allows for code reusability. Instead of writing the same code again and again, we can simply inherit the properties of one class into another. This saves time and effort for developers, reduces the amount of code that needs to be written, and provides a better understanding of code to other developers working in a team. Inheritance also enables you to create new classes that reuse, extend, and modify the behavior defined in other classes."

    "Ans- Single inheritance is a type of inheritance in which a subclass inherits properties and methods from a single superclass. In single inheritance, the derived class uses the features of the single base class1. This allows for code reusability, as the derived class can use the properties and methods of the base class without having to rewrite them.\n",
    "\n",
    "Multiple inheritance is a type of inheritance in which a subclass inherits properties and methods from multiple superclasses. In multiple inheritance, the derived class uses the joint features of the inherited base classes. This allows for even greater code reusability, as the derived class can use properties and methods from multiple base classes.\n",
    "\n",
    "The main difference between single and multiple inheritance is that in single inheritance, the subclass inherits from a single superclass, while in multiple inheritance, the subclass inherits from multiple superclasses. Single inheritance is simpler to implement and understand, while multiple inheritance can be more complex due to the potential for conflicts between inherited properties and methods.\n",
    "\n",
    "Both single and multiple inheritance have their advantages. Single inheritance is easier to implement and understand, while multiple inheritance allows for greater code reusability and flexibility. Ultimately, the choice between single and multiple inheritance depends on the specific needs of your program."

    "Ans- In the context of inheritance, a “base class” is the class whose members are inherited by another class. The class that inherits those members is called the \"derived class\". The derived class inherits all the properties of the base class, without changing the properties of the base class, and may add new features to its own. These new features in the derived class will not affect the base class. The derived class is the specialized class for the base class.\n",
    "\n",
    "In other words, a base class is a general class that provides common properties and methods to other classes, while a derived class is a more specific class that inherits those properties and methods from the base class and can add its own unique properties and methods.

    "Ans- The “protected” access modifier is used in inheritance to specify that a member of a class can be accessed by the members of its derived classes, as well as by members of the same package. This means that if a class member is declared as “protected”, it can be accessed by any class that inherits from the class in which it is declared, regardless of whether the derived class is in the same package or not.\n",
    "\n",
    "The “protected” access modifier differs from the “private” and “public” access modifiers in terms of its level of accessibility. A “private” member is only accessible within the class in which it is declared, while a “public” member is accessible from anywhere. The “protected” access modifier provides a level of accessibility that falls between these two extremes, allowing access by derived classes and members of the same package, but not by other classes.\n",
